**Text Mining Project: Factors Affecting Co-op Program of Drexel Undergraduate Students**

This repository contains the code, report, and materials for the "Text Mining Project" that aims to analyze the factors affecting the Co-op program of Drexel University undergraduate students using text mining techniques implemented in R.

**Project Background**

The "Factors Affecting Co-op Program of Drexel Undergraduate Students" project focuses on extracting insights from student feedback and comments related to the Co-op program at Drexel University. By applying text mining techniques, natural language processing, and sentiment analysis to a dataset containing student reviews and comments, the project seeks to identify key factors influencing the Co-op program experience, uncover trends, and provide actionable recommendations for program improvement.

**Contents**
- Code: R scripts and notebooks containing data preprocessing, text cleaning, feature extraction, sentiment analysis, and topic modeling.
- Report: Detailed report outlining the project methodology, data analysis, findings, and recommendations.
- Datasets: Datasets used for the project, including the student feedback and comments dataset, any derived datasets, and preprocessed data.
- Figures: Visualizations, charts, and figures generated during the analysis.
- References: Relevant research papers, articles, and resources used for the project.

**Project Phases**
- Data Collection: Gathering student & employers feedback and comments related to the Co-op program.
- Data Preprocessing: Cleaning and preprocessing the text data, removing noise, stopwords, and irrelevant information.
- Feature Extraction: Extracting meaningful features and variables from the text data, such as sentiment scores, keywords, or topic clusters.
- Sentiment Analysis: Analyzing the sentiment of student feedback to assess positive, negative, or neutral sentiments towards the Co-op program.
- Analysis and Findings: Interpreting the results, identifying significant factors, and deriving insights regarding the Co-op program.
- Recommendations: Providing actionable recommendations based on the analysis to enhance the Co-op program for Drexel University undergraduate students.
